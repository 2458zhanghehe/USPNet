## Abstract
This paper presents USPNet, a novel model designed for the classification of standard planes in intrapartum ultrasound images, focusing on improving the classification accuracy of small anatomical targets. Intrapartum ultrasound, as a non-invasive, objective, and reproducible method, is increasingly utilized to evaluate labor progress. However, due to the small size of key anatomical features, accurate classification remains challenging. USPNet addresses this challenge by introducing a simplified architecture that incorporates a Shift block, SC-MLP, and ORIConv blocks to enhance feature extraction. Experimental results on two datasets, Zj-AOP and Zj-CD, demonstrate that USPNet outperforms existing advanced models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The proposed model effectively improves the classification of small anatomical targets, providing enhanced support for clinical decision-making during labor.
